# ampparit_funnier_titles

Retrieves the most popular titles from Ampparit.com and mixes them together
to form funny titles. Doesn't use API because Ampparit.com doesn't have one to my
knowledge. May sometimes get confused with some weird titles because I can't predict
what journalists come up next ;)

Usage: If you have Python just run main.py, use pre started command line since the app just closes after it's done

Example:

Ampparit titles: 
* A journalist invented a new title - Look at these results!
* A cat ate a fish - You wont believe what happened next

Results of this application might be (random generated):
* A journalist invented a new title - You wont believe what happened next
* A cat ate a fish - Look at these results!



# Known bugs:
* Some times ampparit don't give html file at first try
